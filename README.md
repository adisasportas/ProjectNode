# Personal Task Manager API

### Welcome to the Personal Task Manager API project! In this project, you will apply the concepts learned in your MongoDB and Node.js course to build a robust backend for a task management application. The API will allow users to perform CRUD operations on tasks, with authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for security.

## Objectives
### Implement JWT Authentication:
 Secure the API with JWT by implementing signup and login functionalities. Ensure users are authenticated before interacting with task management features.

### Develop Express.js Server:
 Utilize Express.js to set up the server, creating a robust API to handle HTTP requests related to task management.

### Integrate MongoDB Using Mongoose: 
Design and implement MongoDB database schemas for users and tasks. Use Mongoose to interact with the MongoDB database from the Express.js application.

### Implement CRUD Operations:
 Create at least three main routes (e.g., /users, /tasks, /categories) supporting full CRUD operations. Organize each route in separate files for codebase organization. Utilize different HTTP methods (POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE).

### Querying and Routing:
 Implement functionality to support querying of tasks and users, such as filtering tasks by status or due date using query parameters.

## Requirements
Authentication: All routes, except for signup and login, must require JWT authentication. Ensure proper token issuance and validation.

### Database Schema:
 Define clear and logical schemas for users and tasks. Include relevant fields such as username, password, email for users, and title, description, status, dueDate for tasks.

### API Endpoints: 
Implement at least three main routes with full CRUD capabilities. For example, /users for user registration, information update, and deletion. /tasks for managing tasks. /categories for organizing tasks into categories.

### Error Handling: 
Implement proper error handling across the API to manage and return meaningful error responses to clients.

### Documentation:
 Provide basic documentation outlining API endpoints, including required parameters and example request/response formats.

### Presentation: 
Be prepared to present the structure and code of the project, explaining the flow, showcasing the code, and demonstrating API interaction using tools like Postman.

## Purpose
This project aims to solidify your understanding of building full-stack applications with MongoDB and Node.js, focusing on backend development with Express.js and Mongoose. It provides hands-on experience in implementing authentication, CRUD operations, database interactions, error handling, and documentation.
